Deploying SPAs and Static Webpages
Section 9, Lecture 102
So you either built a SPA or static webpage (i.e. no Universal app)?

Deploying these kind of apps is super simple!

After building the app (npm run build ), you just need to upload your dist/  folder content (just the content, not the folder itself!) to a static host like AWS S3 or Firebase Hosting.

That's all! 

No other folders or files do need to be deployed since your code has already been built, optimized and prepared to require no Node.js server anymore.
